## Git Cheat Sheet and Branching 

Examples of common git commands. Also practice dealing
with branching and resolving merge conflicts. 

### General Commands
* 'git init' - initialize local git repo in current
working directory
* 'git add filename' - stage 'filename' for commit
* 'git commit -m msg' - commit state file into local repo
* 'git clone url' - clone remote repo 'url' to local
working directory

### Information Commands
* 'git status' - show status of local repo
* 'git log' - list commit history of current branch
* 'git log --oneline' - list commit history (compact
format)
* 'git config --list' - list local repo config settings

### Branching Commands
* 'git branch' - list local branches
* 'git branch branchName' - create local branch 'branchName'
* 'git checkout branchName' - switch to branch 'branchName'
* 'git checkout -b branchName' - create and switch to branch
'branchName'

### Remote Commands
* 'git remote add origin url' - add new remote 'url' with 
alias 'origin'
* 'git push origin branchName' - push current local branch
to remote branch 'branchName'
* 'git pull origin branchName' - pull and merge remote branch
'branchName' with current local branch

## Workflow:
1. Pull latest remote main into local main
	```
	git pull origin main
	```
1. Branch from updated local main
	```
	git checkout -b myBranch
	```
1. Work in local branch, committing frequently
1. When ready to merge, pull remote 'main' into local
branch (must commit first)
	```
	git pull origin main
	```

	* Fix any merge conflicts, then commit
1. Push to remote branch
	```
	git push origin myBranch
	```
1. Create pull request
1. Merge pull request
